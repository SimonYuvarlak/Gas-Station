# Homework

As a homework, you will complete all the steps to create a SCA, fund it with test tokens and making a transaction. Do not forget this section is same as the last two one except we just added one line of code saying `accountType: "SCA"` while initializing user in the `User-Controlled-Wallet` project.

This homework is also helps you to see, if you were uble to understand what you have shown so far. If you have any question, do not hesitate to ask!
